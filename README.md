# Bike Sales Report
I performed bike sales analytics, and designed a Bike Sales Report using Excel.

The bike company wants to determine the trend according to customer's demographics to develop products that suit customers and to make marketing campaigns in the future, in order to increase the company's sales.

Data Cleaning

Removed duplicate values.

Data Processing & Manipulation

I changed some columns data to what we can easily comprehend in visualization. In the marital status column, M text was replaced with Married, while S text was replaced with Single. In the Gender column, M was replaced with Male, while F was replaced with Female. I added a new column for Age group (<30 =Young Adults, <50 =Middle Adults, otherwise =Old Adults).

Data Visualization and Reporting Used Excel (Pivot) to create the dashboard.
